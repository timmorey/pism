//! Describes the PISM grid and the distribution of data across processors.
/*!
  This class holds parameters describing the grid, including the vertical
  spacing and which part of the horizontal grid is owned by the processor. It
  contains the dimensions of the PISM (4-dimensional, x*y*z*time) computational
  box. The vertical spacing can be quite arbitrary.

  It creates and destroys a two dimensional \c PETSc \c DA (distributed array).
  The creation of this \c DA is the point at which PISM gets distributed across
  multiple processors.

  It computes grid parameters for the fine and equally-spaced vertical grid
  used in the conservation of energy and age equations.

  \section computational_grid Organization of PISM's computational grid

  PISM uses the class IceGrid to manage computational grids and their
  parameters.

  Computational grids PISM can use are
  - rectangular,
  - equally spaced in the horizintal (X and Y) directions,
  - distributed across processors in horizontal dimensions only (every column
    is stored on one processor only),
  - are periodic in both X and Y directions (in the topological sence).

  Each processor "owns" a rectangular patch of xm times ym grid points with
  indices starting at xs and ys in the X and Y directions respectively.

  The typical code performing a point-wise computation will look like

  \code
  for (int i=grid.xs; i<grid.xs+grid.xm; ++i) {
    for (int j=grid.ys; j<grid.ys+grid.ym; ++j) {
    // compute something at i,j
    }
  }
  \endcode

  For finite difference (and some other) computations we often need to know
  values at map-plane neighbors of a grid point. 

  We say that a patch owned by a processor is surrounded by a strip of "ghost"
  grid points belonging to patches next to the one in question. This lets us to
  access (read) values at all the eight neighbors of a grid point for \e all
  the grid points, including ones at an edge of a processor patch \e and at an
  edge of a computational domain.

  All the values \e written to ghost points will be lost next time ghost values
  are updated.

  Sometimes it is beneficial to update ghost values locally (for instance when
  a computation A uses finite differences to compute derivatives of a quantity
  produced using a purely local (point-wise) computation B). In this case the
  double loop above can be modified to look like

  \code
  int GHOSTS = 1;
  for (int i=grid.xs - GHOSTS; i<grid.xs+grid.xm + GHOSTS; ++i) {
    for (int j=grid.ys - GHOSTS; j<grid.ys+grid.ym + GHOSTS; ++j) {
    // compute something at i,j
    }
  }
  \endcode
